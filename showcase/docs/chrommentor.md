## Get rapid and intuitive access to your tags

Listening to your feedbacks, we developped a chrome extension to let you reach your tags thanks to description instead of tag itself.

Thanks to [Chrommentor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrommentor/lkjldonlkfgdnflgkiliglncdgmhniek) you can define the tags you want to have quick access to and the description you want to use to refer to them.

To do so, install the [Chrommentor extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrommentor/lkjldonlkfgdnflgkiliglncdgmhniek)

Click on the Commentor logo to reach the extension's options to define the tags you want:

![Reach Options][chrommentor-options]

[chrommentor-options]: /img/chrommentor-options-button.png "Enjoy the included default tags and add your own"

Then head to your favorite versioning platform and press \$ while starting to type a comment.

![Github autocompletion][github-autocompletion]

[github-autocompletion]: /img/chrommentor-github-comment.png "Chrommentor enhance the native autocompletion of github with your custom tags"

## Add your own tags

You can add your own tags if you want to analyze something we didn't. These new tags will be stored in the local storage. Keep in mind they should match with the tags you defined in Commentor :)

## Share your tags with your team

We added a simple button to allow you to export and import tags in your Chrommentor options as JSON files. This will allow you to share your tags easily with your team (why not even version them ?).
